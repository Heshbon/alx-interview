# Island_perimeter

This project focuses on calculating the perimeter of a single island represented in a 2D grid. The grid consists of integers where `1`s represent land and `0`s represent water. The objective is to develop an efficient algorithm that determines the perimeter of the island by analyzing the grid structure.
