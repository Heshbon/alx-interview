# Minimum_operations

The minimum operations project is an algorithmic challenge that involves calculating the minimum number of operations required to reach a specific number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. This problem emphasizes the application of key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to derive an efficient solution. The project requires understanding of dynamic programming, prime factorization, and code optimization.
